# Hi there!!
My name is Chris, I'm a Cybersecurity student, big proponent of Open Source and a passionate Linux user.
Currently studying modern server administration technologies and working towards breaking into DevOps.

## Currently working on:
> I'm testing GitHub issues/discussions as project management tool so you can use those in the respective repositories to see what I'm working on at the moment.
- Rebuilding my [Homelab](https://github.com/chramb/homelab) with IaC. 
- [Gentoo](https://github.com/chramb/gentoo) tooling to ease use and development of and with the distribution.

## Planning to learn:
+ Programming: Go, C, Rust, Zig
+ CI/CD:
  * Custom Github Actions
  * Self-hosted solution (most likely [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org))
